This repository contains the following files:
* README.md: This file
* CodeBook.md: The code book file containing explanations for all variables, their meaning and how the data set was generated.
* run_analysis.R: The R script that reads the data set from a local copy of the UCI Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set and generates a tidy data set. This script assumes that the UCI data set is stored in a folder called "UCI HAR Dataset" within the same directory of the script. However, this can be easily changed in the script.
* tidy_data_set.txt: The data set generated by run_analysis.R
